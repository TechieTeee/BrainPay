# TapQuest: Redefining Digital Engagement and Transactions

## Introduction
TapQuest is an innovative platform at the intersection of blockchain, augmented reality (AR), and NFC wearables. Transforming digital payments and marketing, TapQuest offers a seamless and engaging experience for users and businesses alike.

## Background
The digital advertising space is projected to reach a whopping $440 billion by 2027 (Publift, 2023). In this competitive landscape, companies must innovate to stay relevant and profitable. Rising ad spend, fueled by market competitiveness (Forbes, 2021), has led to increased costs, creating challenges for smaller players. Traditional ad formats are losing effectiveness, with users developing ad blindness and showing lower engagement due to intrusive messages. This shift in user preferences demands a transformative solution. TapQuest, with its groundbreaking fusion of blockchain, AR, and NFC wearables, offers an innovative solution to these challenges.

## The Problem
The bidding war in the digital advertising space has escalated costs, hindering smaller players. Traditional ad formats face decreasing effectiveness due to ad blindness and lower engagement. User preferences are shifting towards shorter attention spans and a desire for more dynamic experiences, requiring a novel solution for digital marketing.
